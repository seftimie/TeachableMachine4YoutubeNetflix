# TeachableMachine4YoutubeNetflix
Spent one quality hour with my kido (sir Karl) training a ML model to play/pause videos from distance on Youtube, Netflix or HBO in a hacky way. We been using Teachable Machine (from Google AI Experiments), some JS and Google Chrome Console. The kid enjoyed a lot the output.
